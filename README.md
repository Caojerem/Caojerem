Practical works of "Introduction to Machine Learning" lecture at MS SIO, CentraleSup√©lec.
    
The goal is to find the most relevant ML algorithm and parameters to predict intel, in a particular case of study.
The dataset is chosen by the students from an open-data portal.</p>

## Projet documentation

Available (in French) at "doc/Rapport.pdf"

## Chosen dataset

The dataset is accessible at [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+from+Single+Chest-Mounted+Accelerometer#).

- The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest
- Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: 52 Hz
- Accelerometer Data are Uncalibrated
- Number of Participants: 15
- Number of Activities: 7
- Data Format: CSV

Labels are codified by numbers :
1. Working at Computer
2. Standing Up, Walking and Going up\down stairs
3. Standing
4. Walking
5. Going Up\Down Stairs
6. Walking and Talking with Someone
7. Talking while Standing

In a first approcch, we have chosen to only consider the dataset of the 1st participant.

## Preprocessing of the dataset

Refer to the documentation and to the file "preprocessing.ipynb"

## ML alogorithm trained from the datasets

The goal is to train a ML algorithm which could be able to predict the kind of activity, according to acceleration measurements.

We are in the case of a classification problem.

Several approaches are avaluated :
- KNN (K Nearest Neighbours) - supervised approach -> see script "KNN_activity_from_acceleration.ipynb"
- DTC (Decision Tree Classifier) - supervised approach -> see script "DTC_activity_from_acceleration.ipynb"
- Kmeans - unsupervised approach -> see script "Kmeans_activity_from_acceleration.ipynb"
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
